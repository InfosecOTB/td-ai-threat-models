|------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | payments-processing-platform-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | 93 | üèÜ Excellent | Broad, balanced STRIDE coverage across actors, processes, and boundary-crossing flows; precise, actionable mitigations (e.g., PKCE, mTLS, token binding, signed webhooks) and strong contextual accuracy. |
| 2 | payments-processing-platform-openai-gpt-5 | 87 | üåü Good | Strong coverage and realism; high-fidelity flow-level threats and merchant/Stripe alignment; minor overemphasis in places but consistently practical mitigations. |
| 3 | payments-processing-platform-anthropic-claude-opus-4-1-20250805 | 85 | üåü Good | Solid, balanced threats across key flows and components with sound mitigations; a few gaps in completeness and proportionality compared to the top two. |
| 4 | payments-processing-platform-xai-grok-4-latest | 67 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Extensive enumeration across categories; mitigations are often generic and occasionally misapplied, but overall coverage enables useful risk discussions. |
| 5 | payments-processing-platform-novita-deepseek-deepseek-v3.1-terminus | 62 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Reasonable breadth with mostly plausible threats; mitigations are concise but often high-level; some categories underdeveloped. |

### 2. Overall Model Maturity

#### 2.1 Evaluation Summary
All models share a materially common DFD: Customer actor; Customer Client in a ‚ÄúCustomer/Internet‚Äù zone; a Merchant Web Server; Stripe API and Stripe Payment Service within ‚ÄúStripe/Web‚Äù; and labeled cross-boundary flows (steps 1‚Äì11). Trust boundaries and process roles are consistently clear and intuitive. Missing data stores and limited decomposition constrain completeness, yet the sequence of flows is logical. As a shared foundation for security analysis, the DFD is readable and sufficient, though adding data stores, authentication/identity components, and explicit data classifications would improve depth.

#### 2.2 Scoring Table

| Dimension                        | Weight | Score | Reasoning |
|----------------------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Clarity and Readability          | 25%    | 80    | Clear trust zones and labeled steps (1‚Äì11); processes are named consistently; visual mental model is straightforward. |
| Completeness and Coverage        | 30%    | 75    | Core components and flows are present, but persistent data stores and identity/secret stores are not modeled; limited decomposition. |
| Accuracy and Logical Consistency | 25%    | 78    | Flow sequence and trust crossings are coherent; the overall lifecycle reflects realistic PaymentIntent orchestration. |
| Usability for Security Analysis  | 20%    | 76    | Adequate for attack-surface reasoning; would benefit from explicit data classifications, protocol/encryption correctness, and datastore inclusion. |

**Overall Model Maturity Total Score (0‚Äì100):** 77  
**Overall Model Maturity:** üåü Good

#### Strategic Recommendations "(Per Model)"  
#### payments-processing-platform-xai-grok-4-fast-reasoning-latest

- Replace generic or misapplied mitigations with targeted ones (PKCE, webhook signatures, token binding).
- Extend spoofing defenses: pinning, DNSSEC, certificate transparency monitoring.
- Add message signing and idempotency for PaymentIntent and internal service flows.
- Strengthen non-repudiation with signed receipts and immutable audit trails.
- Add client-side protections: CSP/SRI, hosted fields/tokenization.

#### Threat Landscape Snapshot "(Per Model)"

| STRIDE Category | High | Medium | Low | Observations |
|------------------|------|--------|-----|---------------|
| Spoofing | 6 | 0 | 0 | Broadly covered across flows; needs stronger control precision. |
| Tampering | 6 | 0 | 0 | Comprehensive but often generic integrity guidance. |
| Repudiation | 0 | 3 | 0 | Logging acknowledged; signatures not consistently specified. |

| Denial of Service | 0 | 4 | 0 | Internal and API DoS present; prioritization unclear. |
| Elevation of Privilege | 3 | 0 | 0 | Addresses EoP scenarios in client and services. |

Wide coverage but mitigations frequently generic; some inaccuracies (e.g., AES payload suggestions vs. TLS).

**Threats & Mitigations Maturity:** ‚úÖ Adequate

#### Strategic Recommendations "(Per Model)"  
#### payments-processing-platform-xai-grok-4-latest

- Replace generic advice (e.g., ‚Äúencrypt payload with AES‚Äù) with correct transport and message integrity controls (TLS 1.3/mTLS, HMAC/signatures).
- Add explicit webhook signature verification and reconciliation against server-side state.
- Specify client-side controls (CSP/SRI, tokenization) to limit exposure of card data.
- Document response minimization practices and masking in logs.
- Incorporate service identity (SPIFFE/SVID) for internal flows to strengthen integrity. 


## 4. Conclusion

- Comparative strengths/weaknesses (threats & mitigations):  
  - Best-in-class models (Anthropic Claude Sonnet; OpenAI GPT-5) provide broad, balanced STRIDE coverage with highly actionable mitigations and strong contextual accuracy.  
  - Solid performers (Anthropic Claude Opus) are near the top but can strengthen non-repudiation and secret lifecycle coverage.  
  - Adequate models (XAI Grok 4 Latest; Novita Deepseek) cover many areas but rely on generic controls; adding targeted payment-grade mitigations (PKCE, webhook signatures, idempotency, tokenization) would notably increase maturity.  
  - Fair to Poor models (XAI Grok 4 Fast Reasoning; Novita Qwen) show breadth but lack realism, balance, and root-cause alignment; the ‚Äúunencrypted flow‚Äù overemphasis should be replaced with integrity/spoofing/non-repudiation fundamentals.  
  - The weakest model (Ollama Qwen) lacks substantive threats and mitigations, making it unsuitable for guiding risk reduction.

- Common DFD-Only maturity: üåü Good (77/100).  
  The shared architecture is clear and logically consistent across files, with labeled steps and trust boundaries. To elevate DFD utility, add persistent data stores, identity/secret services, and data classification details to improve completeness and enable deeper security reasoning.

- Next steps to elevate shared architecture and per-model threat quality:  
  - Extend the DFD with data stores (orders, logs, tokens), secret management components, and explicit data classifications.  
  - Ensure every boundary-crossing flow includes STRIDE-aligned threats and precise mitigations: TLS 1.3/mTLS, PKCE, token binding, message signing/HMAC, webhook signatures with reconciliation, idempotency keys, CSP/SRI, hosted payment fields/tokenization.  
  - Strengthen non-repudiation across all models with digitally signed receipts and immutable, correlated audit logs.  
  - Calibrate severities and prioritization to realistic payment fraud routes (spoofing, replay, tampering, key leakage).  
  - Institutionalize secret lifecycle management: vaulting, rotation, leak detection, and CI/CD hygiene.
