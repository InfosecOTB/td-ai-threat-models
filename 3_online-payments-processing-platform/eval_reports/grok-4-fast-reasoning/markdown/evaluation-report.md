# Comprehensive Threat Model Evaluation Report (Combined)

## Executive Summary & Comparative Analysis

This report evaluates nine AI-generated threat models for an online payments processing platform based on the OWASP Threat Dragon schema. All models share a common data flow diagram (DFD) structure depicting customer interactions, merchant processing, and Stripe integration across trust boundaries (Customer/Internet, Merchant/Web, Stripe/Web). The DFD includes actors (Customer), processes (Customer Client, Merchant Web Server, Stripe API service, Stripe Payment Service), and flows for login, order intent, payment confirmation, and responses. Key differences emerge in the depth, specificity, and coverage of threats and mitigations, with some models providing detailed, context-aware threats while others are superficial or repetitive. Overall, the models demonstrate varying maturity in applying STRIDE, with stronger ones offering balanced coverage and practical mitigations, while weaker ones focus narrowly on encryption gaps or lack nuance. The shared DFD is logically sound but shows opportunities for enhancement in labeling and boundary details. Recommendations prioritize improving threat realism, mitigation specificity, and cross-model consistency to strengthen security posture.

### 1. Threats & Mitigations Maturity Ranking (Across Models)

| Rank | Model Name | Threats & Mitigations Score | Maturity | Reasoning |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | payments-processing-platform-openai-gpt-5 | 90 | üèÜ Excellent | Comprehensive coverage across all STRIDE categories with highly contextual threats tied to specific flows and boundaries; mitigations are detailed, standards-aligned (e.g., TLS 1.3, mTLS), and address root causes like replay attacks and credential leaks. |
| 2 | payments-processing-platform-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | 85 | üåü Good | Strong, detailed threats with in-depth descriptions referencing trust zones and flows; mitigations are practical and PCI DSS-aligned, though slightly repetitive in encryption emphasis. |
| 3 | payments-processing-platform-xai-grok-4-latest | 82 | üåü Good | Balanced STRIDE coverage with realistic threats focused on boundary crossings; mitigations are comprehensive but occasionally generic (e.g., "encrypt all data"). |
| 4 | payments-processing-platform-anthropic-claude-opus-4-1-20250805 | 78 | üåü Good | Good coverage of tampering and disclosure threats with flow-specific details; mitigations are actionable but less emphasis on repudiation and DoS compared to top models. |
| 5 | payments-processing-platform-xai-grok-4-fast-reasoning-latest | 75 | üåü Good | Solid threats tied to positions and flows, with practical mitigations; reasoning is efficient but some threats overlap without deeper chaining. |
| 6 | payments-processing-platform-gemini-gemini-2.5-pro | 70 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Adequate coverage but uneven; focuses on client-side and API threats with relevant mitigations, but misses some internal flows and has fewer threats overall. |
| 7 | payments-processing-platform-novita-qwenqwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct | 65 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Repetitive threats centered on encryption gaps; mitigations are consistent but lack depth in addressing specific STRIDE categories like elevation of privilege. |
| 8 | payments-processing-platform-novita-deepseek-deepseek-v3.1-terminus | 60 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Basic threats with good coverage of tampering and disclosure; mitigations are straightforward but underdeveloped for complex scenarios like repudiation. |
| 9 | payments-processing-platform-ollama-qwen330b | 50 | ‚öôÔ∏è Fair | Minimal threats, mostly focused on unencrypted flows; mitigations are generic and unbalanced, with heavy repetition across categories.

### 2. Overall Model Maturity

#### 2.1 Evaluation Summary
The shared DFD across all models effectively captures the core payment flow with clear trust boundaries (Customer/Internet, Merchant/Web, Stripe/Web) and key elements like actors, processes, and bidirectional flows for login, order intent, and payment processing. Strengths include logical sequencing of steps (1-11) and identification of boundary crossings, which aids in spotting exposure points. Key gaps are inconsistent encryption flags (often false despite HTTPS protocol) and lack of data stores, limiting visibility into persistence risks; the layout is readable but could benefit from explicit data labels on flows for better traceability.

#### 2.2 Scoring Table

| Dimension                        | Weight | Score | Reasoning |
|----------------------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Clarity and Readability          | 25%    | 85    | Flows and elements are well-labeled with step numbers and descriptions; trust boundaries are clearly delineated, though some flows lack protocol details for quick visual assessment. |
| Completeness and Coverage        | 30%    | 80    | Covers essential actors, processes, and flows across boundaries; includes bidirectional elements and positions, but omits data stores and external dependencies (e.g., banks), reducing full-system coverage. |
| Accuracy and Logical Consistency | 25%    | 90    | Flows follow a coherent sequence (login ‚Üí intent ‚Üí confirmation ‚Üí response) without contradictions; boundary crossings are accurately implied, and elements align with payment orchestration logic. |
| Usability for Security Analysis  | 20%    | 85    | Enables identification of high-risk boundary flows; positions and connections highlight exposure, but missing data flows and encryption flags make risk inference somewhat manual. |

**Threats & Mitigations Total Score (0‚Äì100):** 86  
**Threats & Mitigations Maturity:** üåü Good

#### Strategic Recommendations
1. Add advanced threats like API abuse.
2. Include mobile and API-specific mitigations.
3. Enhance repudiation with blockchain.
4. Balance with low-severity threats.
5. Recommend continuous monitoring.

## 4. Conclusion
The top models (GPT-5, Claude Sonnet) excel in detailed, balanced STRIDE application with contextual threats and robust mitigations, making them suitable for high-stakes payments, while lower-ranked ones (e.g., Ollama-Qwen) suffer from sparsity and repetition, limiting their utility. The common DFD is üåü Good in maturity, providing a solid foundation for analysis but needing better encryption flags and data store inclusion to fully support security reviews. To elevate, standardize threat templates across models for consistency, prioritize boundary-crossing risks in future iterations, and integrate automated tools for ongoing validation; this would transform adequate models into excellent ones, enhancing overall platform resilience against evolving threats like API abuse and supply chain attacks.
