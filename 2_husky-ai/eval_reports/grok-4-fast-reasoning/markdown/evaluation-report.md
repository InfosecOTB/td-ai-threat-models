# Comprehensive Threat Model Evaluation Report (Combined)

## Executive Summary & Comparative Analysis

This report evaluates nine Threat Dragon models for the Husky AI system, a machine learning platform for classifying husky vs. non-husky images using Azure services and a CNN model. All models share a common architecture with two trust zones (Experimental and Production), key actors (Engineer, Infra Admin, Azure Cognitive Services, User), processes (Gather Images Application, Jupyter Notebook, Deployment, Simple Python Web Server, API Gateway, Bastion), and data stores (Training and Validation Images, API Key, Machine Learning Model, Source Code and Configuration, Authorized Keys). The models differ primarily in the depth and coverage of threats and mitigations, with some providing detailed, context-specific threats while others are sparse or generic. Overall, the shared DFD architecture is solid but exhibits gaps in encryption for internal flows and stores, leading to risks in data transit and at rest. The threat models vary in maturity, with advanced LLMs (e.g., Claude variants) offering comprehensive coverage and practical mitigations, while others are underdeveloped. Recommendations focus on enhancing encryption, authentication, and cross-zone controls to address common vulnerabilities.

### 1. Threats & Mitigations Maturity Ranking (Across Models)

| Rank | Model Name | Threats & Mitigations Score | Maturity | Reasoning |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | husky-ai-model-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | 95 | üèÜ Excellent | Extensive threats across all STRIDE categories with highly specific, zone-aware descriptions and actionable mitigations; covers supply chain, poisoning, and escalation risks comprehensively. |
| 2 | husky-ai-model-anthropic-claude-opus-4-1-20250805 | 90 | üèÜ Excellent | Detailed threats focusing on credential compromise, data poisoning, and privilege escalation; mitigations emphasize MFA, encryption, and auditing, with strong balance across categories. |
| 3 | husky-ai-model-openai-gpt-5 | 85 | üåü Good | Balanced coverage of spoofing, tampering, and DoS; mitigations are practical but slightly less granular than top models, with good focus on cross-zone risks. |
| 4 | husky-ai-model-novita-qwen-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct | 70 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Solid threats on tampering and disclosure, but fewer instances; mitigations are relevant but lack depth in areas like supply chain and insider threats. |
| 5 | husky-ai-model-novita-deepseek-deepseek-v3.1-terminus | 65 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Covers key areas like spoofing and tampering, but mitigations are basic and uneven; misses some DoS and repudiation threats. |
| 6 | husky-ai-model-gemini-gemini-2.5-pro | 60 | ‚öôÔ∏è Fair | Limited threats, mostly on tampering and disclosure; mitigations are generic and do not fully address methodology balance. |
| 7 | husky-ai-model-xai-grok-4-fast-reasoning-latest | 55 | ‚öôÔ∏è Fair | Sparse threats focused on basic risks; mitigations are underdeveloped, with gaps in coverage for elevation and repudiation. |
| 8 | husky-ai-model-xai-grok-4-latest | 50 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor | Few threats, primarily spoofing and tampering; mitigations are simplistic and do not cover all categories adequately. |
| 9 | husky-ai-model-ollama-gemma327b | 40 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor | Minimal threats, unbalanced toward tampering; mitigations are vague and lack specificity for the system's ML-specific risks. |

### 2. Overall Model Maturity

The shared DFD architecture across all models depicts a clear separation of experimental (development/training) and production zones, with actors interacting via SSH or HTTPS flows. Strengths include well-defined boundaries and flows for data ingestion, model training, deployment, and inference. However, gaps exist in labeling some internal flows as unencrypted and inconsistent encryption on stores, reducing visibility into confidentiality risks. The layout logically flows from external inputs to production serving, but lacks detail on auxiliary components like logging or monitoring.

#### 2.1 Evaluation Summary
The DFD provides a solid foundation for understanding the Husky AI system's data flows, with clear trust zones distinguishing development from production environments. Strengths lie in mapping key processes and stores, facilitating identification of boundary crossings. Key gaps include incomplete encryption annotations on internal flows and stores, which could obscure transit risks, and limited decomposition of auxiliary security controls.

#### 2.2 Scoring Table

| Dimension                        | Weight | Score | Reasoning |
|----------------------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Clarity and Readability          | 25%    | 85    | Elements are consistently labeled with descriptive names; trust zones are visually distinct, and flows use standard symbols, making the diagram easy to follow despite minor overlaps in positioning. |
| Completeness and Coverage        | 30%    | 75    | Covers core actors, processes, stores, and flows; includes key interactions like SSH for admin access and HTTPS for external inputs, but omits details on auxiliary elements like monitoring or backup systems. |
| Accuracy and Logical Consistency | 25%    | 80    | Flows align with system logic (e.g., external to experimental for training, then to production); no major redundancies, though some unencrypted internal flows contradict stated security practices like TLS emphasis. |
| Usability for Security Analysis  | 20%    | 70    | Enables quick identification of boundary risks (e.g., SSH cross-zone), but inconsistent encryption flags and lack of data classification on flows hinder deeper risk assessment and extensibility. |

**Overall Model Maturity Total Score (0‚Äì100):** 78  
**Overall Model Maturity:** üåü Good

4. Include supply chain.  
5. Justify with context.

## 4. Conclusion
The Claude models excel in threats and mitigations with detailed, balanced coverage and strong mitigations, making them suitable for high-maturity environments, while Gemma and Grok variants lag with sparse, unbalanced threats that overlook key areas like repudiation and supply chain risks. The common DFD architecture is üåü Good overall, providing a reliable base but needing consistent encryption annotations to better highlight transit vulnerabilities. To elevate the shared architecture, standardize encryption on all internal flows and stores; for per-model threats, prioritize adding comprehensive STRIDE coverage and ML-specific risks like inversion attacks across all variants, starting with the lower-ranked models to achieve uniform adequacy. Next steps include a unified threat model template emphasizing encryption and auditing, followed by validation through red-team exercises.
