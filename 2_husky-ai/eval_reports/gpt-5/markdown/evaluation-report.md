| 1 | husky-ai-model-anthropic-claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 | 90 | üèÜ Excellent | Broad and balanced STRIDE coverage across actors, stores, processes, and cross-boundary flows; precise, actionable mitigations (e.g., mTLS, cert pinning, SCA, PAM, JIT) and strong alignment to practical controls; minimal redundancy and strong contextual accuracy. |
| 2 | husky-ai-model-openai-gpt-5 | 87 | üåü Good | Comprehensive and realistic threats (including data poisoning, cross-zone pivots, model tampering, and supply chain) with root-cause mitigations (signing, SBOMs, SCA, immutability); minor repetition and a few over-broad mitigations prevent top score. |
| 3 | husky-ai-model-anthropic-claude-opus-4-1-20250805 | 84 | üåü Good | Strong coverage of critical assets and flows; mitigations are specific, layered (e.g., sandboxing, key rotation, model signing) and proportionate; slightly less category depth and fewer cross-checks than the top two. |
| 4 | husky-ai-model-xai-grok-4-fast-reasoning-latest | 78 | üåü Good | Wide-ranging STRIDE threats across many elements; solid mitigations (e.g., SCA, signed artifacts, mTLS) but some duplication and occasional inconsistency; still a credible and useful set. |
| 5 | husky-ai-model-novita-deepseek-deepseek-v3.1-terminus | 70 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Good coverage of internal unencrypted flows and SSH risks; mitigations are reasonable but occasionally generic; limited depth on data provenance and CI/CD trust boundaries. |
| 6 | husky-ai-model-novita-qwen-qwen3-coder-480b-a35b-instruct | 65 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Many threats identified, but several inconsistencies (e.g., encryption states vs. text) and uneven specificity; mitigations often correct but need refinement and tighter traceability. |
| 7 | husky-ai-model-xai-grok-4-latest | 62 | ‚úÖ Adequate | Broad threat set but varying quality; several mitigations are high-level or repetitive; contextual alignment uneven and some cross-zone edge cases insufficiently addressed. |
| 8 | husky-ai-model-gemini-gemini-2.5-pro | 55 | ‚öôÔ∏è Fair | Sparse threats; coverage misses several critical flows and actors; mitigations are generally sound but too few to support comprehensive risk reasoning. |
| 9 | husky-ai-model-ollama-gemma327b | 40 | ‚ö†Ô∏è Poor | Minimal threats and limited component coverage; mitigations not systematic; insufficient for credible, actionable risk posture. |


### 2. Overall Model Maturity

#### 2.1 Evaluation Summary
Across all files, the shared DFD depicts two trust zones (Experimental and Production) with clear core components (ingestion, notebook training, deployment, API gateway, web server, bastion) and relevant data stores. The model effectively exposes key cross-boundary flows (e.g., external ingestion, SSH deployments, production administration) enabling practical risk analysis. Notable gaps include occasional duplication of flows, inconsistent encryption flags versus labels (e.g., flows named ‚ÄúHTTPS‚Äù yet flagged unencrypted), and missing supporting services (IdP, CI/CD control-plane, logging/monitoring). Overall, the DFD is strong enough for effective analysis, with minor consistency and completeness issues.

#### 2.2 Scoring Table

| Dimension                        | Weight | Score | Reasoning |
|----------------------------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Clarity and Readability          | 25%    | 78    | Trust boundaries and component roles are explicit; flows are named and generally understandable. Minor inconsistencies (e.g., ‚ÄúHTTPS‚Äù with isEncrypted=false, repeated ‚Äúupdate‚Äù flows) slightly reduce clarity. |
| Completeness and Coverage        | 30%    | 75    | Core assets, actors, and flows are present. Missing auxiliary services (IdP, CI/CD control-plane, telemetry/logging pipelines) and limited decomposition (e.g., API Gateway policies, service-mesh) constrain coverage. |
| Accuracy and Logical Consistency | 25%    | 72    | Logical structure is sound, but duplication (e.g., two similar bastion‚Üímodel flows) and occasional contradictions between labels and attributes reduce consistency. |
| Usability for Security Analysis  | 20%    | 80    | Attack surfaces and cross-zone ingress paths are clear, enabling practical risk inference and prioritization; layout is readily extensible with additional controls. |

**Overall Model Maturity Total Score (0‚Äì100):** 76
**Overall Model Maturity:** üåü Good

#### Strategic Recommendations "(Per Model)"  
#### husky-ai-model-xai-grok-4-latest

- Replace generic mitigations with specific, enforceable controls (mTLS-by-default, certificate pinning, signed artifacts).
- Enforce signed provenance for code, data, and models; validate in CI/CD and at runtime.
- Adopt tamper-evident centralized logs with correlation for admin/model changes.
- Add detailed protections for model extraction and adversarial inputs.
- Consolidate update flows and define a single controlled route with policy enforcement.

## 4. Conclusion

- Comparative strengths/weaknesses: Anthropic Sonnet and OpenAI GPT-5 provide the strongest, most balanced STRIDE coverage with precise, deployable mitigations and clear threat-to-control traceability. Anthropic Opus and XAI Grok (fast-reasoning) follow closely, with solid breadth but minor duplication and a few inconsistent details. Novita Deepseek and Qwen models are adequate yet need stronger provenance, telemetry immutability, and consistency between DFD attributes and narratives. Gemini and especially Ollama require substantial expansion to meet baseline expectations for threats and mitigations.

- Common DFD-Only maturity: üåü Good (76/100). The shared architecture is well-defined for security analysis, exposing key trust boundaries and cross-zone flows. Improvements should focus on eliminating duplicative/ambiguous flows, reconciling inconsistent encryption flags vs. labels, and adding auxiliary components (IdP/CI-CD/telemetry) to improve completeness and accuracy.

- Next steps:  
  1) Make mTLS a universal internal principle; reconcile all encryption flags vs. labels and remove plaintext flows.  
  2) Enforce signed, attested provenance (code, data, models) and verify at deployment and model load.  
  3) Normalize to a single authoritative model update route per environment with policy/IAM enforcement.  
  4) Implement tamper-evident, centralized logging with detections for admin/model changes; define response playbooks.  
  5) Add explicit adversarial input and model extraction detections in production, with thresholds and action plans.  
  6) Strengthen SSH access with short-lived certs, JIT, PAM, MFA, device posture checks, and session recording.  

These actions will lift both the shared architecture‚Äôs security posture and the per-model threats/mitigations quality, converging toward consistent, high-confidence, and auditable risk management across all models.
